## 🧪 Developer Notes (Clerk Keyless Mode)

When developing locally, Clerk can run in **keyless mode** (without API keys).

In this state:

- Ideal for rapid frontend development

For full authentication behavior, configure:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```

---

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

---
